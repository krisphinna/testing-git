                    <h1>Hi, welcome to my site</h1>
                    <p>With just some few months of development experience, i realise that the typical product creation
                    process between client and developers was defective. Most times developers don't communicate with their clients while handling
                    clients project, resulting in final outcome that do not meet the clients goals.
                    </p>

                    <p>For this reason i am appling a unique development strategy that focuses on communication
                    and transparent design patterns. when i take on a project, i don't just work to build the application according to the client's
                    specification, i go further to update the client to ensure that the project is in alignment with the client's goals. The end product is 
                    the right product, delivered as scheduled and on budget.
